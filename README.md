# the-code-repository-for-time-series-analysis-and-preprocessing
This repository includes code for handling public datasets related to rotating machinery fault diagnosis, covering data reading, preprocessing, sample transformation, and dataset construction. Additionally, it provides various signal processing methods and visualization tools for analysis.

Currently supported signal processing algorithms include averaged FFT, averaged power spectrum, acceleration-to-velocity conversion, STFT, CWT, SCWT, and adaptive nonlinear processing.

Stay updated! We will keep expanding our collection of signal processing methods.
